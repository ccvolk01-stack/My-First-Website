        Mom is the first boss you will encounter in the Binding Of Isaac and most likely you will fail. But eventually this boss will become a breeze for you and you can move right on to mom's heart.

        Boss Rush is really interesting as well as very challenging because in order to get this mark you have to defeat 15 waves of 2 bosses which can be extremly difficult on some characters. Not to mention you have to defeat mom before the game timer hits 20 minutes otherwise you wont even be able to attempt it. Most likely this will not be your first mark and that's perfectly fine!

        Mom's Heart is the first boss that has completion marks in the game thus she is the first boss that allows you to get a significant amount of unlocks. Not too many of these stand out but you will be racking up secrets unlocked the more you defeat this boss!

        Hush is the second boss that requires you to go fast for the entire run. He requires you to beat mom's heart by the time you hit 30 minutes on the run. This is much easier than hitting boss rush though because it requires 8 stages in 30 minutes as opposed to 6 stages in 20 minutes.

        Your first encounter with isaac is very random and every player has their first fight against him at different times because you have to land an angel deal in order to go to the stage to fight him. The Isaac fight isn't really difficult though and eventually you'll unlock the polaroid and be able to go there on command after moms heart.

      <div class="boss-text">
        The Satan encounter is the exact same as the Isaac one except you have to land a devil deal in order to go the correct stage. In my opinion the Satan fight is much harder than the isaac fight but it is easier to get there in the first place so it kind of balances out. Addtionally you'll eventually unlock the negative which will allow you to go the stage on command after mom's heart.

        Mom is the first boss you will encounter in the Binding Of Isaac and most likely you will fail. But eventually this boss will become a breeze for you and you can move right on to mom's heart.

        Boss Rush is really interesting as well as very challenging because in order to get this mark you have to defeat 15 waves of 2 bosses which can be extremly difficult on some characters. Not to mention you have to defeat mom before the game timer hits 20 minutes otherwise you wont even be able to attempt it. Most likely this will not be your first mark and that's perfectly fine!

        Mom's Heart is the first boss that has completion marks in the game thus she is the first boss that allows you to get a significant amount of unlocks. Not too many of these stand out but you will be racking up secrets unlocked the more you defeat this boss!

        Hush is the second boss that requires you to go fast for the entire run. He requires you to beat mom's heart by the time you hit 30 minutes on the run. This is much easier than hitting boss rush though because it requires 8 stages in 30 minutes as opposed to 6 stages in 20 minutes.

        Your first encounter with isaac is very random and every player has their first fight against him at different times because you have to land an angel deal in order to go to the stage to fight him. The Isaac fight isn't really difficult though and eventually you'll unlock the polaroid and be able to go there on command after moms heart.

      <div class="boss-text">
        The Satan encounter is the exact same as the Isaac one except you have to land a devil deal in order to go the correct stage. In my opinion the Satan fight is much harder than the isaac fight but it is easier to get there in the first place so it kind of balances out. Addtionally you'll eventually unlock the negative which will allow you to go the stage on command after mom's heart.

        ??? alsp known as Blue Baby can only be fought after obtaining the polaroid. In the run you wish to fight him you must take the polaroid after you defeat mom and then go up after you defeat moms heart then you can finally go to the chest and fight Blue Baby. The chest is a very interesting stage though as you will get a significant power boost do to the sheer amount of items you'll find. Blue Baby is very similar to the isaac fight.

        The Lamb is the boss you fight when you take the negative instead of the polaroid. The stage you gight them on is called the dark room and instead of starting off with four chests where they give you items; you get devil deals instead. The Lamb is often seen as the harder counterpart to Blue Baby so be ready to give it a few tries.

        In order to fight Mega Satan you have to go through a few hurdles. First you must beat both Blue Baby and the Lamb. Secondly you must destroy two angel statues and fight both gabriel and uriel to get both key pieces. Then you take those two key pieces to either the dark room or the chest and then a giant golden door will appear. You DO NOT have to fight him as soon as you get there and can loot the floor before you fight but once you're in you're in. Good luck!

        Delirum is arguably the most difficult boss in the entire game due to his insane speed and ability to turn into any boss that you have fought. You can fight him by going to the void which you can only do either after the hush fight in the back right of the room, defeating mega satan, Blue Baby, or The Lamb. A portal should appear that will take you there and then all you have to do is actually find Delirum which can be challenging at times.

        Mother in my opion is the SECOND hardest boss in the game and she can only be fought after beating hush 3 times and going down to the alternate floors. I highly suggest you check out the offical isaac wiki linked at the bottom of the page to learn how to do this! After you beat mother you will now have the ability to get tainted characters!

        The Beast is the final boss of the entire game and also requires you to follow a specific path in order to fight him. I als recommend checking out the wiki for that path too. The Beast is arguably one of the easier bosses in the game but you do have to fight Dogma and the 4 Horseman in order to get get to the phase where you fight him which can be challenging.

        Ultra Greed is the only boss on this list that isn't in the normal game mode. Ultra Greed is only able to be fought in Greed/Greedier mode which is an entirely different way to play. To a lot of people this is the least fun mark to get so be warned!
